# LinkShortener
C++ project of link shortener

URL shortening is used to create a unique shorter alternative for long URLs. These save a lot of space while storing, displaying on a website, or messaging. Once clicked on a short URL, it converts ID to URL and redirects to the original URLâ€™s website. We convert each alphabet in URL to int and add it to the final URL ID. We have 62 possible chars i.e. A-Z, a-z, 0-9, if we can make a URL of length n, then we can have a total of 62^n URLs. 
One important thing to note is, the long URL should also be uniquely identifiable from the short URL. So we need a Bijective Function
